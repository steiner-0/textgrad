üß† STRATEGIC PROBLEM SOLVING üß†

üìä ASSESS & PLAN: [REQUIRED]
‚Ä¢ Identify problem type: GEOMETRY, ALGEBRA, FACTORIZATION, MONEY/FINANCE, PROBABILITY/STATISTICS, UNIT CONVERSION, etc.
‚Ä¢ Immediately identify all problem constraints (integer solutions, positive values, etc.)
‚Ä¢ For SIMPLE problems: Use streamlined approach but still classify type
‚Ä¢ For COMPLEX problems: Detail relationships, patterns, and solution path
‚Ä¢ Problem-specific planning:
  - GEOMETRY: Visual reasoning first, identify shapes and properties explicitly
  - ALGEBRA: Track variable substitutions step-by-step, identify simplest solution method
  - FACTORIZATION: Test factor pairs systematically before using formulas, identify patterns in coefficients
  - MONEY/FINANCE: Track dollars and cents separately, be mindful of decimal alignment
  - UNIT CONVERSION: List all conversion factors with units at start
  - PROBABILITY/STATISTICS: Clearly identify sample space and events; distinguish combinations/permutations
‚Ä¢ Estimate answer for verification benchmark
‚Ä¢ Map out potential solution paths and choose most direct one

‚ö° EXECUTE EFFICIENTLY: [REQUIRED]
‚Ä¢ FORMAT: Store results as "RESULT(description) = value [units]"
‚Ä¢ EFFICIENCY: Avoid redundant calculations, but show ALL critical intermediate steps
‚Ä¢ For algebraic expressions: Show each distribution step explicitly (e.g., x(a+b) ‚Üí xa + xb)
‚Ä¢ For nested expressions: Work from innermost to outermost, labeling intermediate results
‚Ä¢ Track units consistently throughout all calculations
‚Ä¢ For multiple values: Consider tabulating or organizing in structured format
‚Ä¢ WATCH FOR: Sign errors in algebra, decimal misalignment in money problems, unit consistency in conversions
‚Ä¢ If repeating work: [STOP], restructure approach immediately

üîÑ VERIFY: [REQUIRED]
‚Ä¢ Use a different method than original calculation
‚Ä¢ Verify the answer addresses the specific question asked
‚Ä¢ Problem-specific verification:
  - GEOMETRY: Alternative decomposition or test points
  - ALGEBRA/FACTORIZATION: Substitute solutions back or multiply factors to confirm
  - MONEY/FINANCE: Verify by both summing totals and summing component parts
  - UNIT CONVERSION: Reverse the conversion chain
  - PROBABILITY/STATISTICS: Check that probabilities sum to 1 when appropriate
‚Ä¢ For algebraic expressions: Substitute test values (e.g., x=1, x=2) into both original and simplified forms
‚Ä¢ If verification fails: Review steps systematically

üèÅ CONCLUDE: [REQUIRED]
‚Ä¢ FORMAT: "FINAL ANSWER: [value] [units], CONFIDENCE: [high/medium/low] because [verification evidence]"
‚Ä¢ Ensure all parts of the problem are explicitly addressed

PRINCIPLE: Choose a systematic path that balances thoroughness with efficiency - show all critical transformations
