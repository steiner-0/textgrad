How much money would the devastated farmer lose if he sold the remaining cattle at the lowered price compared to the amount he would have made by selling them at the original price?",
          "answer": "25200",
          "response": "The rancher originally had 340 cattle priced at $\\frac{204000}{340} = 600$ dollars per head. After losing 172 cattle, he had $340 - 172 = 168$ left. The price dropped by $150, resulting in a new price of $600 - 150 = 450$ per head. The loss from selling the remaining cattle at the lowered price versus the original price is calculated as:\n\n$168 \\times (600 - 450) = 168 \\times 150 \u2192 \\boxed{25200}$",
